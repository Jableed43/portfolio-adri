## 🧠 Challenges and Solutions

### 1. Creating a Simple and Attractive Site
💡 *Solution:* I used a medical clinic template from [colorlib.com](https://colorlib.com) and adapted it to the specific field, ensuring a clear and professional user experience.

---

### 2. Designing a Representative Logo
💡 *Solution:* I utilized AI to generate an SVG logo that represents the holistic approach of psychomotricity, using a body figure with a puzzle texture.

---

### 3. Visually Representing the Profession
💡 *Solution:* Images generated with AI, in a childlike/Disney style, conveying empathy and approachability, ideal for the target audience of children and families.

---

### 4. Effective Communication Channel
💡 *Solution:* Integration of WhatsApp, email, Instagram, and a form using EmailJS that sends directly to the professional. All accessible from the header, contact section, and footer.

---

### 5. Presenting Professional Experience
💡 *Solution:* Information visible on the homepage and in the "About Me" section, with a downloadable CV and details of experience in various institutions.

---

### 6. Mailing and Hosting Without a Backend
